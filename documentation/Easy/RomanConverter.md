# Roman to Integer

LeetCode problem : ![Roman To Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: _I, V, X, L, C, D and M_ and each symbol has assigned a unique value to it.

| Symbol | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1000  |

Basic principal behind converting Roman symbols to an inter value is that :-

- if a symbol placed after another of equal or greater value adds its value; e.g., II = 2 and LX = 60
- and if a symbol placed before one of greater value subtracts its value; e.g., IV = 4, XL = 40, and CD = 400.
